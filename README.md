# Joycon-Driving RC car 

A joycon that drives an RC car through a websocket and webapplication. 

## Inspiration

This all stemmed from a one-day project, where I hacked an old RC car with my pi and motor driver. 
It was a fun way to learn electronics and how code gets implemented. I hope to add onto this with more exciting features, like a payload, or autonomous driving. 

## Project Goals
- learn about electronics (voltage/wiring/soldering)
- learn about websockets/practice making webapplications

## Tech Stack 
(update with phone image of the tech stack)

webapplication side:

- javascript
- html
- css
- gamepadcontroller API
- websocket

python side:
- GPIO
- python

## AI
I used AI for the python side of the websocket and for debugging the websocket when it broke forever (sry)

## Timeline

Future potential additions:

- car that drives autonomous & maps/draws on the floor
- person-follower
